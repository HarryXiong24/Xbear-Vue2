# Mini-TS-Vue

## Description

A mini-vue framework developed by Typescript.

## Usage

yarn install
yarn dev
yarn build
```

```bash

The simple example is located in the examples folder, so the packaging file entry set by Webpack is located in index.ts under the examples folder.

The file in the directory under src is just an empty file. Please modify it yourself according to your needs.
